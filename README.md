# CatlikeCoding_Basics_2024
This repository was created for educational purposes and to track my progress. I am working on it in my spare time, along with other projects, so I donâ€™t aim to be too consistent or come back every day. However, I do need to follow these two main rules:

1. I should add something new to the project, not just copy the tutorial.
2. Complete all 7 modules at my own pace.

1. Game Objects and Scripts (in progress)
2. Building a Graph
3. Mathematical Surfaces
4. Measuring Performance
5. Compute Shaders
6. Jobs
7. Organic Variety

Special thanks to Jasper Flick for creating these modules and helping newbies like me learn programming.
